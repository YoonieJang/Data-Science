# Algorithms

## Supervised Learning
It is the machine learning task of learning. It uses *labeled datasets* to train algotithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

- Regression
- Linear Regression
- Ordinary least Squares
- Logistic Regression
- Stepwise Regression
- Multivariate Adaptive Regression splines
- Classification
  - K-nearest neighbor
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - C4.5 
- Ensemble Learning
  - Boosting
  - Bagging
  - Random Forest
  - AdaBoost

## Unsupervised Learning
It refers the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to idenfity patterns within data sets on its own. The data points are neigher classified nor labeled.

- Clustering
- Dimension Reduction
- Neural Networks
- Self-organizing map
- Adaptive Resonance Theory
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

## Semi-Supervised Learning
- Clustering
- Generative models
- Lo-density separation
- Laplacian regularization
- S3VM
- Heuristic approaches


## Data Mining Algorithms
- C4.5
- CART
- k-Means
- SVM
- Apriori
- EM
- PageRank
- AdaBoost
